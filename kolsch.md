Ingredients
-----------

- 8.7 lbs. (3.9 kg) Pils malt (< 2 °L)
- 1.3 lbs. (0.59 kg) wheat malt (2 °L)
- 5.5 AAU Tettnanger (bittering) (1.35 oz./38 g of 4.1% alpha acid)
- 1 oz. (28 g) Tettnanger hops (flavor)
- 1 tsp. Irish moss
- White Labs WLP029 (Kölsch) or Wyeast 2565 (Kölsch) yeast
- 3/4 cup DME or corn sugar

If you want to be true to style, start with as thick a mash as you can, at roughly 110 °F (43 °C). Increase the mash temperature gradually by about 1 °F (1/2 °C) per minute by infusing it very slowly with near-boiling water. To avoid excessive hot spots, keep stirring the mash gently while you are raising the temperature. Once the mash reaches about 146 °F (66 °C), stop for a 30-minute rest, which favors the formation of easily fermentable maltose. Then employ the next saccarification rest, for about 15 minutes, in the upper 150 °F range (around 70 °C). Then ramp the temperature up to sightly below 170 °F (roughy 78 °C). It is OK to thin out the mash at this point. Some German breweries have as much as 80% of their net kettle volume in water in the mash tun before they start the sparge. During the sparge, check the mash temperature periodically, and make sure it remains steady. The sparge for a Kölsch may be relatively fast; fortyfive to sixty minutes is not unusual. Do not continue sparging when the run-off drops below a gravity of 1.010.

Boil the Kölsch for about 70 minutes. Add the bittering hops about 10 minutes into the boil and the flavor hops, as well as the Irish moss, about 10 minutes before shut-down. You can get by with only two additions of German noble hops. If your palate craves a smidgen more aroma, however, you can add an extra
